## Install the Postman App

Download and install the Postman app from [this link](https://www.postman.com/downloads).


### Fork the Collection

1. In the Postman desktop app, click on the top search bar and type **Salesforce**.
1. Click **Salesforce Developers** under Teams.

1. Enter a label for your fork (e.g.: ‚ÄúMy fork‚Äù).
1. Select a workspace (the default ‚ÄúMy Workspace‚Äù workspace is fine).
1. Click **Fork Collection**.


## Configure the Collection

1. Click **Salesforce APIs**
1. Open the **Variables** tab.
1. If needed, update the `CURRENT VALUE` of the `url` variable with either:

    - `https://test.salesforce.com` for sandboxes or Scratch orgs.
    - `https://login.salesforce.com` for production, Trailhead Playground and Developer Edition orgs.
    - your custom My Domain URL.

1. Click **Save**.


## Authenticate with Salesforce

You'll need to authenticate with Salesforce to access the APIs. Doing so grants you an access token that is valid for a certain duration.

Repeat this step whenever your access token expires.

1. Click **Salesforce APIs**
1. Open the **Authorization** tab. The authorization type should be set to OAuth 2.0.
1. Click **Get New Access Token**. This opens a browser tab with the Salesforce login screen.
1. Log in to your Salesforce org.
1. Click **Allow** to grant access to "Salesforce APIs Collection for Postman" to your org.

    At this point, if your environment is correctly set up, you should see a success message and you should be redirected to the Postman app.

    If the redirection doesn't happen, you may need to authorize popups in your browser.

    <p>
    Note: these instructions are for Chrome but the steps should be similar with other browsers.

    1. Click the popup error in the address bar, choose to allow popups from Postman:

        ![Allow popup screenshot](doc-gfx/web/allow-popup.png)

    1. Refresh the page and allow the browser to open the Postman app:

    </p>
    </details>

1. Copy the value of the `instance_url` field from the token details view. Make sure not to copy the line break character.

    ![Grant access screenshot](doc-gfx/app/manage-token.png)

1. Click **Use Token**.
1. Open the **Variables** tab.
1. Update the `CURRENT VALUE` of the `_endpoint` variable with the value that you just copied from the `instance_url` field in the access token details.
1. Click **Save**.


## Execute a Request

1. Expand the collection and select the `REST > Limits` request.
1. Click `Send`.

At this point, if your environment is correctly set up, you should see a `200 OK` status. This means that you have successfully authenticated with Salesforce and that you can now use the other collection‚Äôs requests.

See [additional documentation](README.md#additional-documentation) for more information on how to keep the collection up to date and work with multiple Salesforce orgs.
